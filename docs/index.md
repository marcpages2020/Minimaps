# Minimaps

## What's a minimap?
A minimap is a miniature map representation located in a part of the screen. It often displays the different points of interest or elements the player might be interested in locating in the game and depending on the game it can also display the position of allies and enemies.  
In order for the player to be oriented it normally has an N indicating where the north is. 

## Why to use a minimap?
The minimap is a game element that has created a lot of controversy for various reasons:
### Inmersion
Minimaps have been accused of breaking the inmersion of the player in the game because of being a static UI element which is not actually a part of the game, in other words, unless you get to do a diegetic minimap it won't be a part of the game so you take the risk of breaking the player's inmersion into the game. 
### Position
Later we will talk about where a minimap can be displayed and where it should to be optimal but in general people who are against the use of minimaps argument that it along with other UI elements is placed in a screen position which is not natural for human perception.
To make this point clear we have to take a deeper look at how human vision works. 
This is more or less how our brain sees the world even we don't consciouscly see it this way. In the middle of our field of vision stands the foveal vision and the rest is composed by the peripheral vision. The foveal vision is made by our cone cells located mainly in the middle of our retina and they send clear colored images to our brain while the peripheral vision is made by our rod cells which send uncolored and less clear images to our brain. This is why our eyes always move to try to keep the important elements of our environment in the center of the vision. 
So, if important information should be in the middle of our vision it's quite ironic that important UI elements are in the corners of the screen where the player won't see them clearly or will have to change the focusing point quite often to be aware of this information.
