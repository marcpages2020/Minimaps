I've made a personal research on how minimaps work, how different games have approached them and how to implement one in C language. You can take a look at my repository here: 
https://github.com/marcpages2020/Minimaps

In this release you can see the final result of the implementation and if yoy want to learn about the whole process you can either visit my website:
https://marcpages2020.github.io/Minimaps/

Or try implementing it downloading the project exercises in the repository.

In the excutable you can move the map using the arrow keys or clicking directly onto the minimap. 

Have fun!
